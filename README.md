# Unit 1

Introduction to Research Ethics and the Scientific Method

1. "What is the Purpose of Research?" It's crucial to understand the main purposes of research: exploration, description, and explanation.
The scientific method is a fundamental approach in research, involving observation, hypothesis, reasoning, and testing, with variations depending on the field of study.
Types of Reasoning in the Scientific Method

2. This unit focuses on the core types of reasoning used in the scientific method: Deductive and Inductive reasoning.
Deduction leads from an idea to an observation, requiring accurate assumptions and is often used in controlled scientific settings.
Conversely, induction moves from observation to idea and is more practical for everyday problem-solving.
Research Ethics

3. Understanding research ethics is essential for any research project, particularly those involving people.
The key principles of research ethics, as outlined in the Menlo Report, include respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest.
Ethics vs. Morals

4. While ethics and morals both concern right and wrong, they are distinct concepts. As discussed in white hat/ethical hacking by Mitchell (2018), ethical considerations may differ in various scenarios.
Professionalism in Research

5. Researchers must maintain professionalism in all aspects of their work.
The BCS Code of Conduct guides professionalism in Computer Science, including information on data protection and intellectual property.

### Formulating and Revising Research Questions:

  * Formulating research questions is the process of defining the specific inquiries we aim to address through your research. These questions guide the study, setting its direction and purpose.
  * Revising research questions involves refining and improving the clarity, relevance, and feasibility of our inquiries. This step is essential to ensure that our research questions are well-structured and aligned with the research objectives. It may require adjustments based on new information, feedback, or evolving perspectives.

### Parts of a Research Proposal and Presentation:

  * A research proposal is a comprehensive document outlining the key elements of the research project. It typically includes sections such as the research question, literature review, methodology, timeline, and budget.
  * Learning how to present our thoughts in a research proposal is about effectively communicating the research plan. This includes organizing the ideas, making a compelling case for the importance of research, and demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.
  * Proper presentation ensures that the proposal is coherent and persuasive.

### Understanding a Literature Review:

  * A literature review is a critical examination of existing research and scholarly works relevant to the research topic. It serves several purposes, including providing context, identifying gaps in current knowledge, and supporting the rationale for the research.
  * Performing a literature review involves conducting a systematic search of academic databases and sources to gather relevant publications. This step also entails reading and summarizing the key findings and arguments in the selected literature.
  * Presenting a literature review requires structuring the collected information in a coherent and organized manner, usually in the form of a written narrative. It should offer a synthesis of existing research, highlight the state of knowledge in the field, and establish how your research fits into the larger scholarly conversation. Proper presentation ensures that your literature review is informative and contributes to the credibility of your research.

# Unit 3

### Research Design Types:

***Exploratory Research:***
* Purpose: Exploration of specific research area aspects with an undefined problem, leading to a better understanding of the situation.
* Example: Investigating the effectiveness of Customer Relationship Management in mobile marketing.
  
***Conclusive Research:***
* Focus: Specific insights verification and decision-making support.
* Subtype: Descriptive Research, describing elements or causes in a research area.
* Example: Critical analysis of social media as a marketing strategy.

### Research Methods:

***Qualitative Research:***
* Data Gathering: Focus groups, case studies, observations, surveys/polls, and interviews.
* Purpose: Understanding experiences, behaviours, and emotions, exploring how and why events occur.
* Associated with inductive approaches.

***Quantitative Research:***
* Data Gathering: Experiments (including observations), case studies, surveys/polls.
* Purpose: Collecting numerical data for statistical analysis, and discovering patterns and relationships.
* Addresses "how much," "how many," and "to what extent" questions.
* Associated with deductive approaches.

***Mixed Methods Research:***
* Integrates both qualitative and quantitative research for a comprehensive approach.

### Methods of Data Collection:

1. Primary Research: Direct data collection from subjects.
2. Secondary Research: Gathering data from previously published primary research, such as case studies, articles, magazines, newspapers, books, etc.

### Additional Explanation:

1. Exploratory Research serves to investigate and gain insights into a research area when the problem is not clearly defined. The aim is to enhance understanding rather than reach conclusive results.
2. Conclusive Research differs by having a more specific focus, typically within Descriptive Research, which aims to describe elements or causes in a research area. The goal is to verify insights and aid in decision-making.
3. Qualitative Research involves gathering data about experiences, behaviours, and emotions from a set of respondents. It is particularly useful in exploring the "how" and "why" of events, making it associated with inductive approaches. Tools for data collection include focus groups, case studies, observations, surveys/polls, and interviews.
4. Quantitative Research focuses on collecting numerical data for statistical analysis. It is used to discover patterns and relationships, often addressing questions of "how much," "how many," and "to what extent." Deductive approaches are commonly employed in quantitative research, and data is collected through experiments, case studies, and surveys/polls.
5. Mixed Methods Research integrates both qualitative and quantitative approaches, offering a more comprehensive understanding of a research topic.

The choice of research method is crucial, as it determines the type of data collected and analyzed to answer research questions. Researchers can opt for primary research (direct data collection) or secondary research (relying on previously published research). Each method has its advantages and limitations, making the selection of primary or secondary research a key decision in the research process.

# Unit 4

### Case Studies:

*  Case studies involve in-depth research and analysis of individuals, groups, or specific situations to gain a deeper understanding of a phenomenon.
*  They are valuable for developing hypotheses and exploring complex issues.
*  However, they cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships, and bias and atypical respondents can limit their external validity in descriptive research.

### Focus Groups:

*  Focus groups gather insights and opinions from a small group of individuals (6-10) about a specific topic.
*  Participants should share a common background and be representative of the target market.
*  Focus groups aim to answer "why," "what," and "how" questions, providing rich qualitative data about motivations and attitudes.

### Quantitative and Qualitative Observation:

*  Quantitative observation involves measuring numerical values and using objective data for statistical analysis.
*  Qualitative observation focuses on non-numeric characteristics and involves observing respondents in a natural setting from a distance.
*  Qualitative observation is useful for exploring human behaviour and social dynamics. Researchers can vary their level of involvement, from complete observer to full participant.

# Unit 5

### Conducting In-Depth Interviews:

* In-depth interviews are a common qualitative research method.
* These interviews are one-on-one conversations with a single respondent at a time.
* Researchers use in-depth interviews to gather detailed and in-depth information from each participant.

***Explanation:***
In-depth interviews involve deep and open-ended conversations with individual participants. This method allows researchers to explore a specific topic or issue thoroughly. It is particularly valuable when researchers need to understand complex personal experiences, attitudes, or opinions. By engaging with respondents one at a time, researchers can delve deeply into their perspectives, experiences, and insights.

### Surveys as a Quantitative Data Collection Method:

* Surveys are a fundamental quantitative data collection method.
* They come in various types, including online surveys.
* Surveys are used to gather data on opinions, trends, and other quantitative aspects of a topic.

***Explanation:***
Surveys are structured questionnaires designed to collect standardized information from a large number of respondents. They are widely used in research to gather quantitative data, such as numerical ratings, preferences, or responses to closed-ended questions. Online surveys have become popular due to their accessibility and efficiency in reaching a broad audience. Surveys are valuable for studying trends, conducting market research, and understanding public opinions.

### Using Multiple Methods in Research:

* Qualitative and quantitative methods are often used together in research.
* Combining methods can provide a more comprehensive understanding of a research area.
* Researchers use each method based on the specific research objectives and the type of information they need.

***Explanation:***
Researchers frequently use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to gain a holistic perspective on a research topic. Qualitative methods, like in-depth interviews, provide insights into individual experiences and deep understanding, while quantitative methods, like surveys, offer numerical data for statistical analysis. The choice of methods depends on the research goals, and using a mixed-methods approach can yield more comprehensive results.

### Pre- and Post-Testing Methods:

* Pre and post-testing methods involve assessing a situation before and after an intervention.
* These methods provide a "before-and-after" view of the impact of a new process or system.
* They are valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of changes and interventions in research or practical applications.

***Explanation:***
Pre- and post-testing methods are commonly used in research to measure the impact of an intervention or change systematically. They involve collecting data before implementing a new process or system and then collecting data after its implementation. This approach allows researchers to assess whether the intervention had the desired effect and provides valuable insights into the cause-and-effect relationship between the intervention and the observed outcomes. These methods are particularly useful for program evaluation and assessing the effectiveness of interventions.
